Hi I am MohammadHosein Jalali

I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and am currently pursuing further education in data mining at the University of Shahid Beheshti. With a background in backend development and a strong command of pure Python programming, I have spent the past year developing and maintaining a system test framework. I bring over 4 years of experience in software development with Python, and I also have some frontend experience with JavaScript. My passion lies in implementing best practices for building robust software and delivering high-quality code, with a specific focus on acceptance tests. I am committed to ensuring the reliability and excellence of software systems.
